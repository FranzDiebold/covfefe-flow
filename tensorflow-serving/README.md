# TensorFlow Serving

[TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/) is the official way for deploying and serving machine learning models.



## Models
The models are stored in the [`models`](./models/) folder.



## Deployment
For the sake of simplicity the prebuilt [epigramai/model-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/epigramai/model-server/) Docker image is used, see the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).
